# InsuredMine Task 1

This project is a Node.js-based API that allows users to upload XLSX/CSV data into MongoDB using worker threads, search for policy information by username, and aggregate policies by each user. The project is designed with a modular and secure structure for better maintainability.

## Task Requirements

1. **File Upload API**: Upload XLSX/CSV data into MongoDB using worker threads.
2. **Search API**: Retrieve policy information based on the username.
3. **Aggregation API**: Provide aggregated policy data by each user.
4. **Modular MongoDB Schema**: Store each data category in separate collections for efficient querying.

## ðŸ›  Key Features

1. **File Upload API** â†’ Uploads XLSX/CSV data into MongoDB efficiently using **worker threads** (ensuring non-blocking operations).  
2. **Search API** â†’ Retrieves **policy information based on the username**.  
3. **Aggregation API** â†’ Provides **aggregated policy count per user**.  
4. **Well-Structured MongoDB Collections** â†’ Each entity (users, policyinfos, agents, policycarriers, policycategories, etc.) is stored separately for **better query optimization**.  
5. **POST Requests Instead of GET** â†’ Ensures **security and scalability** by handling sensitive data in request bodies rather than exposing it in URLs.  
6. **Modular Code Structure** â†’ Organized into separate **config, models, controllers, routes, and workers**, making it easy to scale and maintain.
